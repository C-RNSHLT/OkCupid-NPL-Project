# OkCupid

This project is an exercise in natural language processing (NLP). Specifically, we shall analyse a large
data set containing biography-essays and labels scraped from the dating site OkCupid to establish
whether certain text/language is a strong identifier for a given label.


### Results
The results of our analysis Na¨ıve-Bayes and evaluation of our model are presented in Table 1.
The three classes, sex, age and ethnicity, are presented and divided into applicable subgroups. Sex is divided in male - female; age is split into ≤ 30 and > 30; and ethnicity is divided by white and non-white. Our model is analyzed on both essay0 (self-summary) and essay4 (interests). Precision,
recall and F1-score are all calculated to give a full and extensive evaluation of the performance of our
accuracy.
Moreover, Table 2 presents the strong identiﬁers for a label with a likelihood ratio for the given
n-gram.
